# 🎨 Artist Streak Tracker

A simple yet powerful web app to help you build consistent creative habits through daily and weekly streak tracking.

## About

Hey! I'm **John Lhoel Morillo**, a BSCS student at Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges. I created this project as a way to help artists, students, and creatives stay motivated and accountable with their work. Whether you're practicing digital art, sketching, or any form of visual creation, this app makes tracking your progress fun and rewarding.

## Features

- **Dual Streak System**: Track both daily (max 3 uploads per day) and weekly (max 21 uploads per week) streaks
- **Visual Calendars**: Monthly heat map for daily progress and yearly view for weekly consistency
- **Profile Customization**: Upload a profile picture and set your username
- **Achievement Titles**: Unlock 38+ titles across different tiers (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythic) as you build your streaks
- **Milestone Notifications**: Get celebratory alerts when you hit major milestones (7 days, 30 days, 100 days, etc.)
- **Art Gallery**: Browse and view all your uploaded artwork in a beautiful grid layout
- **Smart Streak Logic**: Automatically resets daily counts at midnight and weekly counts on Sundays
- **Local Storage**: All your data is saved locally on your device—no account needed

## How to Use

1. **Set Your Name**: Enter your artist name in the profile section
2. **Upload Your Art**: Click "Choose Image" to upload your daily artwork (limit: 3 per day)
3. **Watch Your Streaks Grow**: See your daily and weekly streaks increase with each upload
4. **Unlock Titles**: As your streaks grow, new titles unlock that you can display on your profile
5. **Check Your Progress**: View the calendar heat maps to visualize your consistency
6. **Browse Your Gallery**: Click any image to view it in fullscreen

## Technical Stack

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Animations, gradients, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Pure JS, no frameworks (localStorage for persistence)

## Key Achievements in This Project

- Implemented complex streak logic with proper date handling
- Created responsive calendar heat maps for both monthly and yearly views
- Built a tier-based title system with visual animations
- Optimized file uploads with proper error handling
- Added accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard support)
- Designed smooth animations and transitions throughout

## Notes

This app stores everything locally using the browser's localStorage API. Your data stays on your device—perfect for privacy and offline use.
